 # Tech Descriptions
 adm_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "My secretary of state assures me that the switch to clover as a fodder crop and the addition of the turnip in a 'four field' rotation will increase yields in agriculture. I am inclined to promote this idea."
 adm_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "The invention of steam power has led to significantly better means of transportation. With railroads we can transport goods and people very quickly over vast distances."
 adm_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "In the modern world tolerance and equality are becoming increasingly important. Our advisors suggest that we look into the possibility of abolishing the idea of state religion in favor of secularism."
 adm_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "In the 19th century in Europe and North America, there were movements advocating universal male suffrage. The democratic movement of the late 19th century, unifying social democrats, particularly in Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand used the slogan Equal and Common Suffrage."
 adm_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "Making machines from regulated replaceable parts will save a lot of resources as the whole machine won't have to be replaced if just one part of it breaks."
 adm_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "Assembly lines, designed for the sequential organization of workers, machines and parts, would allow faster manufacturing of goods along with decreased workload for the workers."
 adm_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "Progressivism is the support for or advocacy of improvement of society by reform. As a philosophy, it is based on the idea of progress, which asserts that advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization are vital to the improvement of the human condition."
 adm_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "With the increased supply of electricity we are now able to bring it to all major factories. That would allow them to produce greater amounts of products."
 dip_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "The availability of canned food played a crucial role in 19th century, feeding the enormous armies and offering explorers and colonialists a taste of home in unfamiliar lands."
 dip_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is a type of steam powered vessel, typically ocean-faring and seaworthy, that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically drive propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s."
 dip_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "The modern history of petroleum began in the 19th century with the refining of paraffin from crude oil. The Scottish chemist James Young in 1847 noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the Riddings colliery at Alfreton, Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. In 1846, Baku had the first ever well that drilled with percussion tools to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration."
 dip_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "Wooden warships have become very vulnerable to explosive or incendiary shells. Protecting the ships by iron or steel armour plates would help them survive naval combat."
 dip_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "It's often vital to know quickly if something significant happens. With the help of a telephone we could deliver messages across great distances almost instantly."
 dip_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "After extensive research, William Soltau Davidson commissioned the cargoship Dunedin to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the Dunedin sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage."
 dip_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "The radio would not only allow us to quickly deliver messages to other countries and the army, but also provide the masses with information and propaganda."
 dip_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "The dreadnought, larger, better armed and better armored than any ship before, would certainly become the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century."
 mil_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "Originally developed for siege purposes, the howitzer fired a high angled projectile over the fortifications and into the town inside. The field howitzer, a lighter more mobile variant, would fire an explosive shell above enemy troops. Mixed with other artillery types, it added to the effectiveness of artillery brigades."
 mil_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "The percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, was the crucial invention that enabled muzzleloading firearms to fire reliably in any weather. The percussion cap replaced the flint, the steel 'frizzen', and the powder pan of the flint-lock mechanism."
 mil_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "The Minié ball, or Minni ball, is a type of muzzle-loading spin-stabilized rifle bullet named after its co-developer, Claude-Étienne Minié, inventor of the Minié rifle. The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile which was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun."
 mil_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "A rifled breech loader is an artillery piece which, unlike the smooth-bore cannon and rifled muzzle loader which preceded it, has rifling in the barrel and is loaded from the breech at the rear of the gun. The spin imparted by the gun's rifling gives projectiles directional stability and increased range. Loading from the rear of the gun leaves the crew less exposed to enemy fire, allows smaller gun emplacements or turrets, and allows a faster rate of fire."
 mil_tech_cs_37_desc:0 "European armies continued to develop bolt-action rifles through the late 19th century, adopting tubular magazines and later box magazines. The Mauser Gewehr 98 was considered the epitome of this type of action, and its descendents became the standard against which all such rifles are measured. World War I marked the height of the bolt-action rifle's use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs."
 mil_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "The mechanism of the Maxim Gun employed one of the earliest recoil-operated firing systems. This system made it vastly more efficient and less labor-intensive than previous rapid-firing guns."
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "Indirect fire is aiming and firing a projectile without relying on a direct line of sight between the gun and its target. Aiming is performed by calculating azimuth and elevation angles, and may include correcting aim by observing the fall of shot and calculating new angles."
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "Although technology had dramatically changed the nature of warfare by 1914, the armies of the major combatants had not fully absorbed the implications. In the face of modern warfare, digging in was standard practice. To attack frontally was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy."

However, the fall of Gaul "to the roaming barbarians" in the 4th century not only hastened the demise of the Empire as a whole but also contributed to the rise of the savage Franks and to that despicable Imperial usurper Charlemagne and his seed. The title of "Holy Roman Emperor" that every Frankish or Germanic King has laid claim to on the throne of Ceasar must not be allowed to continue. Rome must unite and show to the rest of the world "through the might of its legions" that there can only be one true "Holy Roman Emperor".

All these reasons may seem justly founded on historical facts but we and every Roman know that the fall of our Empire was not mainly due to these things, but rather due to the unification and systematic attacks across our Northern borders by the Germanic and barbarian hordes. Many a times the Empire had gone through civil wars, its people through plagues and there has always been corruption on some form or another. However, systematic attacks by Germanic and steppe hordes contributed mainly to its fall and destruction over a millenia ago. We as Romans must now finally come together and bring the full brunt and weight of our armies on Germania and its savage people. We must take the lessons of the past and apply what we've learnt over the centuries to finally be-rid ourselves of the menace across the Danube, otherwise Rome may once again fall indefinitely if we do not act!"

Hence, the intelligentsia has tasked our administration to locate a new source of labor and what better place to start looking than in Africa. Besides, for hundreds of years both the Arabs, Indian and Chinese merchants have been dealing in the slave trade over there, not to mention our European rivals such as the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and French all get their labor force from Africa, so why can't we? It may be an immoral trade but how can we as a nation compete on the global stage if we sit idly by and ignore the resources that the Dark continent has to offer, whatever shape or form they may be. We have plenty of weapons that we can trade with local Africans along the Ivory and Gold coasts for slaves, slaves who are themselves kidnapped and sold to foreigners by their own people.

Tales of revered pagan Hindu Gods spew forth from the mouths of Sikhs, Monks and commoners a like and the smell of aromatic spices fill the air amongst the cacophony of sounds and bells chiming within huge step-pyramid like temples with interiors covered in gold, whilst numerous golden pagan idols studded in diamonds, pearls, saphires and rubies at every altar, not to mention the local savage nobles known as Maharajas who are carried around in golden chairs, covered in fine silks adorned with gold-diamond jewelry and rings laden with sapphire and ruby stones. It is even said that the greatest ruler of them all, the Great Mughal Emperor lavishes himself even more whilst sitting upon a peacock throne plated in gold, studded with diamonds and precious stones. The Portuguese hearing of India's riches and hungry for her spices quickly established trading ports at Goa and the newly independent Dutch are eying nearby Sri Lanka with the intent of also establishing a port their. Our government on the other hand has been relatively slow to commit and invest in India, something we may end up regretting if we do not act soon, for it is rumored that the French are also preparing an expeditionary force to India in hopes that France will also set up base on the peninsula. The admiralty and their Majesties have tasked us with not only preventing any French moves but also with the capture of Indian ports on both sides of the sub-continent.

The trade that flows out of Chinese ports such as Canton can not be understated, for the Pearl River Estuary is the main financial artery into and out of China and is always busily crowded with ships "Junks" that are laden with gold, silks, tea, china-wares and other precious goods and commodities. Through our observations and analysis of China's situation. The Admiralty has concluded that Britain must take a slice of the pie, which can be done through the seizure of a remote and relatively ignored island known as Kowloon. Kowloon it-self has no fresh water source and is very sparsely populated with people primarily concentrated within the small fishing village of Hong Kong. This may present a problem in the future, for the only way to grow any potential settlement there is to venture forth onto the mainland and seize a chunk of the adjacent shore. China though has vast armies can still pack quite a punch en-mass despite being technologically backwards. This is why the military board has suggested that in order for us to take Kowloon and any nearby land that we must carry out a different tactic, one involving a certain drug known as Opium! The Chinese are addicted to this stuff and hopefully will be too stoned to do anything or stand up to our armies when battle on land or at sea commences. Our government has also ordered us to take any peace offer involving the island of Kowloon and the nearby adjacent lands, even if it only means renting the island for 100 years, since the money we'll make off trade there will more than surpass any maintenance costs that this potential new colony will incur."

 october_revolution.1.d:0 "Throughout June, July, and August 1917, it was common to hear working-class Russians speak about their lack of confidence and misgivings with those in power in the Provisional Government. Factory workers around Russia felt unhappy with the growing shortages of food, supplies, and other materials. They blamed their own managers or foremen and would even attack them in the factories. The workers blamed many rich and influential individuals, such as elites in positions of power, for the overall shortage of food and poor living conditions. Workers labelled these rich and powerful individuals as opponents of the Revolution, and called them words such as \"bourgeois, capitalist, and imperialist\". In September and October 1917, there were mass strike actions by the Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in Baku, textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and railroad workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, more than a million workers took part in strikes. Workers established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a social revolution. Workers were able to organize these strikes through factory committees. The factory committees represented the workers and were able to negotiate better working conditions, pay, and hours. Even though workplace conditions may have been increasing in quality, the overall quality of life for workers was not improving. There were still shortages of food and the increased wages workers had obtained did little to provide for their families. By October 1917, peasant uprisings were common. While the uprisings varied in severity, complete uprisings and seizures of the land were not uncommon. The October Revolution had started."

The Bolsheviks delayed the assault because the revolutionaries could not find functioning artillery. The Bolsheviks also prolonged the assault for fear of violence since the insurrection did not generate violent outbreaks. At 6:15 p.m., a large group of artillery cadets abandoned the palace, taking their artillery with them. At 8:00 p.m., 200 cossacks left the palace and returned to their barracks. While the cabinet of the provisional government within the palace debated what action to take, the Bolsheviks issued an ultimatum to surrender. Workers and soldiers occupied the last of the telegraph stations, cutting off the cabinet's communications with loyal military forces outside the city. As the night progressed, crowds of insurgents surrounded the palace, and many infiltrated it. While soviet historians and officials tended to depict the event in heroic terms, the insurrection and even the seizure of the Winter Palace happened almost without resistance. At 9:45 p.m, the cruiser Aurora fired a blank shot from the harbor. Some of the revolutionaries entered the Palace at 10:25 p.m. and there was a mass entry 3 hours later. By 2:10 a.m on 26 October Bolshevik forces had gained control of the palace. After sporadic gunfire throughout the building, the cabinet of the provisional government had surrendered."

As potato yields dropped dramatically, Europe was confronted with unrest from their pesantry. In Ireland, the famine caused the deaths of over one million, and combined with emigration, saw the drop in Irish population by roughly a quarter. The Irish in particular would lead violent revolts against Britain for its apparent mistreatment and neglect of the crisis."

For generations, historians have both wondered and speculated as to its true purpose, but recent excavations and observations have led many to conclude that the city "built by the Nabataeans" was it-self divided into different areas, with a treasure vault "occupying the famous facade that greets all incoming visitors" on one end followed by a series of buildings on the skirts "dug into the mountains" where inhabitants, traders and officials would reside. One of the many reasons why so many historians have been skeptical on the purpose of Petra is because the Nabataeans were originally a nomadic group. So to suggest that they all of a sudden gave that up to settle down "historians feel" only leads to more unanswered questions as to why and what caused this sudden and drastic shift in the Nabataean's own sedentary attitudes."
