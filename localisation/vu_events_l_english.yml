In 1525, during the aftermath of the Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521), Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, and his nephew, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern, agreed that the latter would resign his position, adopt Lutheran faith and assume the title of Duke of Prussia. Thereafter referred to as Ducal Prussia, remaining a Polish fief. Thus in a deal partially brokered by Martin Luther, Roman Catholic Teutonic Prussia was transformed into the Duchy of Prussia, the first Protestant state.

 vu_pagan.1.d:0 "Norse colonizers discovered and settled Greenland around the year 1000. Since then, a small colony on Southwestern coast has been established. It reached its peak prosperity around 13th century, after which it began slowly declining due to many reasons such as climate changes, depletion of resources, declining help from Iceland, lowered trade relations from black death and declining importance of Icelanding fish exports. After many harsh years, last remaining settlements there gave up of further continuing this agony. What could've been salvaged, was salvaged and ships filled with norse refugees are set to soon arrive in Iceland. What should we do about those norse refugees?"

From now on, Aspand ruled this land semi-independendly posing major problem to Qara Qoyunlu. Despite many pitty conflicts and battles, the rebelion is sill going on and old Aspand still controlls the majority of southern territories. Aspand does not have an heir and he's getting old, so his uprising may end very soon, but we cannnot expect the best outcome and do nothing."

The Musha'sha'iyya were a Shiite sect founded and led by Muhammad ibn Falah, an Iraqi-born theologian who believed himself to be the earthly representative of Ali and the Mahdi messiah. Beginning in 1436, ibn Falah spread his messianic beliefs amongst the less powerful Arab tribes along the area of the Khuzestan and Basra, gaining converts in an attempt to forge a strong tribal alliance. In 1441, they succeeded in capturing the city of Hoveyzeh in Khuzestan, and during the following ten years the Musha'sha'iyyah increased their strength and consolidated their power in the area around the city and the Tigris. \n \nNow that Qara Qoyunlu is ridden by civil war and internal conflicts, a perfect opportunity appears to spread the power and influence of Mushasha. We can use their instability to demand land in Lower Mesopotamia that is populated by our shiite brothers. We must continue our early military ambitions that fueled by Muhammad ibn Falah's zealous millenarian theology, which significantly influences our military tactics."
 vu_middle_east.4.a:0 "By the sword of Islam, those lands are our!"
 vu_middle_east.4.tooltip:0 "We will send an envoy to Qara Qoyunlu and their rebels, demanding all of Lower Mesopotamia area that they own to be ceded to us. They will answer soon but BEWARE! This mission has average chance to succeed. If they will not submit to our demands, a war may break out!"

Long time ago Avars were nomadic people just like the Tatars or Turks who would conquer their way all the way to Pannonian Basin. Shall we continue their legacy or shall we settle for modern lifestyle?"

This horde-like state, which originally settled Pannonian Basin, has been crushed over 650 years ago. Now new hordes of Avar warriors that united their Caucasian lands are seeking a return the the old days of glory. One thing is known, it is a real threat and soon european powers will have to deal with nomads' ambitions."

 vu_mission_events.4.t:0 "Future of the Cossack Host"
 vu_mission_events.4.d:0 "Our horde in its rapid expansion has secured the lands on both banks of Lower Dnieper. Those lands are home territory to Cossacks - fearsome slavic warriors living off the steppe. Cossacks have been known for their strength and countless raids on foreign territory. While they may be excellent allies, they definetely will not accept being put under yoke and will likely demand great autonomy. Now that their lands are under our control, what shall be the future of the Cossack Host?"
 vu_mission_events.4.a:0 "Raze it to the ground"
 vu_mission_events.4.tooltip:0 "We will dismantle Cossack Host and raise the steppe to the ground.

 vu_mission_events.4.c:0 "Reestablish autonomous Cossack Host"
 vu_mission_events.4.tooltip2:0 "We will continue the Cossack Host and allow them to stay at their territory. We will gain Cossack support in our army at the cost of pre-agreed 20 years of self-governance, during which cossack land will have little use for us."

 vu_mission_events.5.d:0 "With Carpathian basin standing right on our doorsteps, our men can no longer wait but to ask if at this point it's better to just declare invasion for the whole region like the mighty Avar Khaganate nomads once did ages ago.

As the news spread, more and more Nordic people begin adopting reformed doctrine. Since it fits well with Nordic culture, there is little that one can do to stop it... at least for now. While more people move there to seek shelter or preach about new ideas, we can only watch as the whole region sweeps out of control from corrupt Papacy and bishops. Truly turbulent times are ahead for this Peninsula."

As the reformation soars through the Europe, they state that it's finally time to end the rule of corrupt catholic church on British Isles. With strong support and wide spread they send us ultimatum. We must sign a decree in which we will aknowledge the reformation, dennounce the corrupt papacy, and declare protestantism and lollardy valid religion in our country. In reality this will make us join the reformation. How shall we respond while another civil war is on the horizon?"

Byzantines control a strip of land from Selymbria to Mesembria they took some time ago while we were occupied by important matters. Now that their last hopes from european crusaders seem futile, we are in right position to demand those lands back, right where they rightfully belong.

Somehow, despite all the odds, the last undisputed continuation of the Roman Empire is still holding to its last holdings in Greece and Thrace. Is truly everything lost? Our fate is not sealed yet! We may die in upcomming decade but even if we do so, shall we cling to decaying walls like a bunch of rats? Our empire may be done for soon but it is to our hands if we enter the grave blind or bearing a bloody sword. If there is a chance for the wheel of Fortuna to turn up in those final days, me must take every opportunity there is! \n \nIf we want to have a slight chance of surviving the Ottoman plague, we must take all the efforts into finding every possible mean of surviving.

In 1453 he joined the defence of the Byzantine Empire during the Fall of Constantinople with about 600 Ottoman defectors by his side.

While great accomplishment for one, it truly is the darkest day for the defeated side and decisive devastating hit for all of christian Europe. \n \nThe mighty has fallen. After over 1000 years of continuous existance, Eastern Roman empire has fallen like its western brother did millenium ago. Could that mean the end of an old era and beginning of a new epoch?
