 bogomilist_new_religion_desc: "Bogomilism is a Christian Neo-Gnostic sect founded during First Bulgarian Empire by the priest Bogomil. The Bogomils called for a return to what they considered to be early spiritual teaching, rejecting the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities. This allowed Bogomilism to spread quickly though Balkans, evantually leaving boundries of Bulgaria and Byzantine Empire. The Bogomils were dualists or Gnostics in that they believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body. They did not use the Christian cross, nor build churches, as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging, fasting, celebrating and dancing. In 1444 Bogomilist heresy has been erradicated from Bosnia and is only present in few areas of Hum and Bosnia."

 nestorian_religion_desc: "Nestorianism is a Christian theological doctrine that upholds several distinctive teachings in the fields of Christology and Mariology. It opposes the concept of hypostatic union and emphasizes that the two natures (human and divine) of Jesus Christ were joined by will rather than personhood. Nestorius' teachings brought him into conflict with other prominent church leaders, most notably Cyril of Alexandria, who criticized especially his rejection of the title Theotokos ("God-bearer") for Mary, the mother of Jesus, and issued 12 anathemas against him at a council in Rome in 430. Nestorius and his teachings were eventually condemned as heretical at the Council of Ephesus in 431, and again at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which led to the Nestorian Schism; churches supporting Nestorian teachings broke with the rest of the Christian Church. After these incidents the nestorians relocated in the east such as India, Persia, Babilonia, Khasgar and even China. That's why other christians call them as the Church of the East. In 1444 Nestorian communities are still present in Northern Mesopotamia and few remote regions of Middle Asia."

In Taoism, the Tao is the source of everything and the ultimate principle underlying reality. Taoism teaches about the various disciplines for achieving perfection through self-cultivation. This can be done through the use of Taoist techniques and by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the all, called 'the way' or 'Tao'. Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize wu wei (action without intention), naturalness, simplicity, spontaneity and the Three Treasures - compassion, frugality and humility. In 1444 Taoism is scattered in various regions of China, mostly the southern part."
