 BtPLegacyIberianFlavour.EVTNAME1:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies?"
 BtPLegacyIberianFlavour.EVTDESC1:0 "The Kingdom of Sicily had after the defeat of René of Anjou in 1443 been unified into a single entity under the Crown of Aragon. However, Alfonso V of Aragon had fathered an illegitimate son, and so during his reign decided to once again split up the Two Sicilies into two constituent kingdoms: One controlling the islands of Sicily & Malta, while the other controlled the parts on the Italian Peninsula. Upon his death, the rule of Naples was ceded to this illegitimate son, Ferdinand, while his brother John II of Aragon incorporated Sicily into the Crown of Aragon. This sparked a series of events such as Pope Calixtus III laying claims over all of Naples as a papal fief (Though he died before he could push these claims), as well as causing great unrest among the Neapolitan nobility. Eventually, when the Italian Wars erupted some decades down the line, the French kings claimed rightful succession to Naples itself and attempted its conquest. This ultimately failed, and Naples reunited under the Crown of Aragon 10 years later. And so, the Two Sicilies would remain ruled by Aragonese, and later Spanish, kings for centuries."

The appeals of lawlessness have not been lost on our privateers; several have already abandoned their commissions and turned pirate.\n\nThe gossip in Port Royale is that someone calling himself the Red Impostor has proclaimed himself as Pirate King and has begun a massive recruitment campaign in order to seize control of Port Royale."

 bt_birkarls:0 "Birkarls"
 desc_bt_birkarls:0 "The Sami People held a notable autonomous position in the medieval and early renaissance period. They were taxed by whatever nation that currently claimed ownership of their lands, but were otherwise left alone. In Sweden, a particular organisation known as the Birkarls arose and was responsible for the taxation of the Sami people, to the point of complete monopoly. It is notable that this was not a de jure position that they held, but rather a de facto one, signifying the autonomous rule of the monarch at the time, who in fact resided in Denmark. Nevertheless, they provided the monarch with valuable Sami furs that benefitted the nation. The status quo was kept until the Centralization reforms of Gustav Vasa, who figured that removing the middle hand that were the Birkarls would greatly increase the size of the Swedish treasury."

 tundra_terrain:0 "Tundra"
 tundra_terrain_desc:0 "Cold regions with scarse vegetation and animal life. Where it's too cold for trees to grow but not cold enough for ice sheet to form. Tundra suffers from severe winters and short, chill summer. It's dominated by shrubs and grass which makes it somewhat easy to traverse. Terrain can vary from flat to hilly but it's generally swampy."
 cold_mountains:0 "Extreme Mountains"
 cold_mountains_desc:0 "Cold mountains, covered in snow for entire year or most of the year. Very high elevation with nearly no vegetation. Those mountains can vary between average and extremely high elevation but their common feature are very low temperatures and little to no plant life. Those mountains, while extremely good for defense, will not be a good place to live in."
 desert_ranges:0 "Desert Ranges"
 desert_ranges_desc:0 "Hills, highlands and peaks located in deserted climate. This terrain combines downsides of both desert and mountain terrain type. Extreme temperatures, uneven terrain and scarse animal & plant life. This terrain is hostile to any permanent settlements."
 dry_highlands:0 "Dry Highlands"
 dry_highlands_desc:0 "Drylands located on elevated and uneven terrain. Hard, infertile soil, lack of lush vegetation, and hot envirorment filled with hills and rocks are not perfect conditions but definetely better than desert."
 swamp:0 "Swamps"
 swamp_desc:0 "A swamp is a forested wetland considered to be transition zones because both land and water play a role in creating this environment. Swamps also vary in size and are located all around the world."
 tropical_highlands_terrain:0 "Tropical Highlands"
 tropical_highlands_terrain_desc:0 "Tropical highlands are areas covered with jungle forests that also have high elevation and very steep or uneven terrain, making it very hard terrain to traverse. Tropical Highlands combine jungle and hill features making this terrain very tough to develop and build on."
 salt_flats:0 "Salt Flats"
 salt_flats_desc:0 "Extreme type of desert. This terrain represents flat, desolate fields of thick salt crust. Fields of salt are bottom floor of periodic lake or remnants of long-evaporated body of water. Extreme envirorment creates almost perfectly flat surface that is devoid of any plant life and animals. Excellent source of salt but very hard place to inhabit."
 mediterranean_grasslands:0 "Mediterranean Grasslands"
 mediterranean_grasslands_desc:0 "Unique type of landscape typical for mediterranean climate. Sunny, dry summers and mild wet winters cause the land to be filled with evergreen bushes and trees of hard leaves. Land can vary in elevation but is rather open, with many small dumps and rocks scattered around the terrain. Somewhat more pleasant than drylands. Easy to live on."
 dry_river:0 "Desert River Valley"
 dry_river_desc:0 "River cutting through deserted or dry lands. Offers safe heaven for various plants and animals. While great for communication, narrow strip of lush vegetation around river quickly transitions into hostile desert offering very small arable terrain. Soil is harsh and sandy but it's better than loose sand. Many civilizations built irrigation systems around river to maximize useful area."
 alluvial_plains:0 "Alluvial Plains"
 alluvial_plains_desc:0 "Fields of fertile and arable land created by vast mineral deposits of meandering river. Throughout time river's floods and changing flow left the terrain with thick layer of material perfect for cultivation. While this terrain is perfect for farming, unpredictable floodings and patches wet terrain are not ideal for dense urban areas."
 fertile_highlands:0 "Fertile Highlands"
 fertile_highlands_desc:0 "Fertile plains located on elevated and uneven terrain. Productive, rich soil hosts limited amount of trees and is ridden with rock formations and steeps. Good place for cultivation despite high altitudes and terrain that is hard to traverse and build on. While not as good for production as grasslands or farmlands, those lands are much better to defend."

 #New colonial region naming (Sidenote, I could not be arsed to do proper adjectives, so they're copy-pastes):
 #Italian names, based off of an old post from deserk, modified through discussion on the BT Discord:
 COLONIAL_ALASKA_LA:0 "Alasca"
 COLONIAL_CANADA_LA:0 "Cabotia"
 COLONIAL_EASTERN_AMERICA_LA:0 "Vespuccia" #The explorer Vespucci is apparently the namesake for the term America. Could not be more fitting to place this name here.
 COLONIAL_LOUISIANA_LA:0 "Vittoria" #Suggestion from Alexious, native Italian speaker.
 COLONIAL_CALIFORNIA_LA:0 "Nuova Apulia"
 COLONIAL_MEXICO_LA:0 "Messico"
 COLONIAL_THE_CARRIBEAN_LA:0 "Nuove Isole Egadi"
 COLONIAL_COLOMBIA_LA:0 "Veneziola" #Suggestion from Math5615, also a given name by Amerigo Vespucci, namesake of modern Venezuela.
 COLONIAL_PERU_LA:0 "Terra Andina" #Suggestion from Alexious, default Peruvian colony
 COLONIAL_PERU_LA_2:0 "Altopiano Andino" #Suggestion from Alexious, south Peruvian colony
 COLONIAL_LA_PLATA_LA:0 "Fiume Argenteo" #Grammatically modified to be more Tuscan-dialect based by Alexious
 COLONIAL_BRAZIL_LA:0 "Terra di Papaga" #Suggestion from Chrysocyon
 COLONIAL_AUSTRALIA_LA:0 "San Atanasio"

 #COLONIAL_BAHAMAS_LA:0 "Bassa Marea" #Suggestion from Chrysocyon & Alexious
 COLONIAL_GREENLAND_LA:0 "Ultima Thule" #Suggestion from Alexious. I am aware it has Nazi connotations, but given its original meaning, the farthest northern lands on the borders of the known world, it makes sense for Greenland in this case, especially given its Graeco-Roman origin. It also was the historical Latin name for Greenland used in the time period.

Their international influence and success were due to their geographical location, situated at the hearth of the trade roads and waterways coming from Italy, Flanders, Paris and Germany, but also by the enlightened management of the counts of Champagne. They were mainly held in the cities of Lagny, Troyes, Provins and Bar-sur-Aube and the counts also protected the Jewish community, which actively participated in business development of these towns. The fairs foreshadow by their economic and influence throughout Europe, the first international financial centres. Our fairs allow us an international recognition and make our country one of the major economic power of the world, we have to perpetuate these in order to bring wealth in our land."

 chp_rose_of_provins:0 "Rose of Provins"
 chp_rose_of_provins_desc:0 "The legend wants that around 1240 Thibault IV of Champagne and Navarre had brought from the Holy Land a rose of excellent quality in the region and which he made important plantations in the lands of the city of Provins. The rose gardens of Provins soon became famous, and the use of the rose was extremely common in medicine and religious ceremonies. Thus, the flower became the symbol of the refinement of Champenoise court and the rose emblem of Lancaster probably represents the rose of Provins, as well."

 chp_the_paraclete_desc:0 "The Paraclete was a prestigious Benedictine women's abbey founded by Abélard and Héloïse during the 12th century in the bishopric of Troyes and was the first only feminine order. The abbey illustrated a monastic model based on the erudition and represented an attempt to recognize women's intellectual equality."
 chp_wine:0 "Wine of Champagne"
 chp_wine_desc:0 "Produced since the 7th century in the region, wines of Champagne really started to receive recognition during the 17th century under the impulse of local Parisian families. Aging very badly in barrels, the wine is then conserved in glass bottles with corks, a new way of conserving wine developed by the English, but it becomes, in return, naturally sparkling. This sparkling character causes many worries to winemakers, so much that it was nicknamed 'wine of the devil' because of bottles that exploded under pressure. However, the wine became popular in England which allows its continued production. We should exploit the wine of Champagne to establish amical relations with foreign powers."

 cor_genoese_towers_desc:0 "The Genoese towers were coastal towers built along our island mostly by Genoa in an attempt to defend Corsica from the Barbary pirates who started to sack the coasts, and this during three centuries. The construction of these towers began in the 16th century, and in 1730 Corsica was the home of 120 towers of this type scattered all over the coast. A garrison of local men was present almost permanently in these towers. Our country being surrounded by water, we should pursue this defense tradition."

 cor_pieves_desc:0 "The oldest known administrative division of Corsica is the pieve, a word coming from the Latin plebs (people) which already designated, a century before our era, an administrative district established by Rome. Though, the medieval pieve corresponds to a geographical and political organization quite different from the ones of the Roman constituencies. Indeed, depending of the era, the pieves were either a religious, civil, military or even political division, making them very versatile."

It is also considered to be the first constitution in the world granting the right to vote to women, when they become householder. Long live the Corsican Nation!"

It formed part of the 'Marca Hispanica', a buffer zone formed by Charlemagne in order to protect the Carolingian empire. It is traditionally thought that he was responsible for restructuring the country, reintroducing Christianity to its people and overseeing the construction of monasteries.

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC5:0 "As the Enlightenment spread across Europe, several important advancements in science were made by natural philosophers. One of these advancements concerned the complex science of bees and their biology, a topic that had not previously been researched. Some notable pioneers were Jan Swammerdam & René Ferchault de Réamur, who used microscopes to dissect bees to understand internal bee biology. They observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but it was not until François Huber had his advisor conduct careful experiments that they understood the mating process of bees. They found that queens were inseminated through a number of successive matings with male drones, which occurred high in the air, distant from their hive. They were also the first to describe bees' reproductive organs. Huber is today regarded as the father of modern bee-science for his discoveries and research while simultaneously breaking new ground in the formative years of modern biology."

 PriceChanges_BeyondTypus.EVTDESC6:0 "Beekeeping in Medieval and Renaissance Europe was a complex science that no regular peasant really understood. Beekeeping was therefore mostly left to the monks in abbeys, where the precious honey and beeswax was produced. This was not the only reason for its generally limited production, but in order to obtain said produce, beehives had to be destroyed, thus ruining any potential reuse of the bee colony. It also disallowed any potential selective breeding. This gradually changed during the 18th and 19th centuries, where successive inventions revolutionized beekeeping. Among these were Thomas Wildman's adjustments to beehive assembly. He fixed parallel arrays of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive. The bees would fix their combs onto these, which allowed for easy removal of beecombs without destroying the hive itself. These movable comb hives were later perfected by Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth, who made use of the fact that there was a specific clearance between the wax combs which bees left unblocked by wax, something Huber had previously discovered. Langstroth carefully designed a series of woooden frames in a rectangular hive box which were easily removed by beekeepers for emptying or inspection. Langstroth's invention ultimately lead to the commercial mass production of honey in the western world."
